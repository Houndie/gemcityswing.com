# Travis Hartman

Travis sat alone in a buggy Marsh<br/>
'I need some swing dance' he'd casually remark<br/>
Loves to teach others and spread his passion<br/>
But his strong point is definitely not fashion<br/>
He's Travis he's Travis he's Travis he's got some flair<br/>
(1 bar instrumental)<br/>
He's Travis he's Travis he's Travis and check that hair<br/>
