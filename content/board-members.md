# Elena Trafton (President)

# Kyle Girtz (Vice-President)

# Emily Stienecker (Treasurer)

Emily started swing dancing at the University of Dayton in 2010, and immediately fell in love. She has been avidly dancing ever since. She ran the University of Dayton Swing Dance Club the last 2 years of her undergrad, and has also been teaching the beginner lesson series there for the past 2 years. She enjoys teaching, dancing, and travelling, and hopes to get all new dancers to love swing dancing as much as she does!

# Vahid Schwart (Secretary)

Vahid started swing dancing at the Ohio State University by taking a ballroom dance class when he needed to fill up credit hours. Little did he know that he would fall in love with lindy hop and swing music. Outside of dancing you'll usually find Vahid riding his bicycle as his preferred means of transportation.

Travis sat alone in a buggy Marsh<br/>
'I need some swing dance' he'd casually remark<br/>
Loves to teach others and spread his passion<br/>
But his strong point is definitely not fashion<br/>
He's Travis he's Travis he's Travis he's got some flair<br/>
(1 bar instrumental)<br/>
He's Travis he's Travis he's Travis and check that hair<br/>
