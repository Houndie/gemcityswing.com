Gem City Swing was founded in 2015 by a group of swing dancers who were unhappy with the size of the swing dance scene in Dayton and wished to introduce more people to swing music. After an arduous search, we eventually found a home with Ned Peppers Bar in the Oregon District, and started hosting our weekly dance there. We've since grown out of that space and have been dancing at the [American Czechoslovakian Club](https://goo.gl/maps/FTHUeuSBqKnNEJgQ6) on Valley street.

We're not in this because we want to make money or promote ourselves. We like dancing, having fun, and meeting people. Our lessons, our dances, and every event that we run is done with the purpose of introducing as many people to swing as possible and having a blast in the process.

It is our goal to promote the education and enjoyment of Lindy Hop and other swing dances in Dayton, Ohio and surrounding areas, by offering social dance events, dance instruction, workshops, social activities, as well as other events deemed necessary for the promotion of swing dances. We are an organization staffed by people who simply love the dance and want as many people as possible to feel that love as well.
