**IT'S BEGINNER MONTH!!**

If you've thought it would be fun to try swing dancing, now's the time! Come join us every Tuesday in May at 7:00 PM for our beginner series followed by a social dance to practice your new moves. The beginner lesson is an hour long from 7:00 to 8:00, the social dance is from 8:00 to 9:30, and the cover is $5 at the door. No partner or previous experience required.

Indoor swing dancing (or any partner dancing for that matter) is a high risk activity. We strongly recommend that everyone vaccinate and if you do not feel well, please stay home and get well so you can come join us on the dance floor.

For the beginner class, we’ll teach you swing basics from scratch so you can get out on the floor and start dancing! Throughout the lesson we rotate partners frequently to give everyone a chance to practice moves, so show up even if you don’t have a dance partner. We teach different moves every week, so even if you attended the lesson last week, feel free to come back again…you’ll have a chance to really familiarize yourself with the basics and learn some cool new moves to show off every week.

After the lesson we social dance from 8:00-9:30, allowing you to really show off your stuff. We rotate our DJs every week, and each of them has a large library of swing songs to play you, guaranteeing the tunes never get old. Throughout the night we sometimes have small events, such as jam circles (where dancers can choose to show off their skill), snowballs (an introductory activity that gets everyone dancing), and birthday jams (celebrations for those having a birthday this month) – make sure to stick around!

Our weekly dances are held every Tuesday at the American Czechoslovakian Club. For the latest event information, please check our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/gemcityswing
