Beginner Swing Lesson:

Never been swing dancing before? Drop in our beginner lesson at 7:30. No experience or dance partner required! We'll teach you swing basics from scratch so you can get out on the floor and start dancing! Throughout the lesson we rotate partners frequently to give everyone a chance to practice moves, so show up even if you don’t have a dance partner. We teach different moves every week, so even if you attended the lesson last week, feel free to come back again…you’ll have a chance to really familiarize yourself with the basics and learn some cool new moves to show off every week. 

Series Lesson:

If you've tried our beginner lesson and are ready to make a learning commitment, join us for our Series lessons from 7:00 to 8:00 pm! Our weekly series lessons build on each other throughout the month so you can keep improving and get the most out of swing dancing! We encourage both newcomers and seasoned dancers to take our series lessons.

Our series lessons are Lindy Hop in February and Charleston in March!

Social Dance:

Our weekly dances are the best place to get introduced to the world of swing dancing. After our lessons we social dance from 8:00-9:30, allowing you practice, show off what you've learned, and have fun! We rotate our DJs every week, and each of them has a large library of swing songs to play you, guaranteeing the tunes never get old. Throughout the night we sometimes have small events, such as jam circles (where dancers can choose to show off their skill), snowballs (an introductory activity that gets everyone dancing), and birthday jams (celebrations for those having a birthday this month)–make sure to stick around!
