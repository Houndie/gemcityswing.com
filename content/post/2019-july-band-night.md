This week’s dance is going to be extra long because we have Brenny’s Bandits to play amazing tunes for us at the American Czechoslovakian Club ([922 Valley St, Dayton, OH 45404](https://goo.gl/maps/FTHUeuSBqKnNEJgQ6)). We’ll have food and dress up nice for this special dance! The beginner lesson starts at 7:30 PM, the series lesson starts at 7:00 PM, and the social dance starts at 8:00 PM. Because of the live band this week, the dance will cost $10. The series lesson will cost $15. Taking either of the lessons will get you into the social dance for free!

Our weekly dances are the best place for one to get introduced to the world of swing dancing. Your night starts at 7:30 with a beginner lesson (No additional charge when attending the dance!) that gives you the basics and a few moves so that you can get out on the floor and start dancing! Throughout the lesson we change partners frequently to give everyone a chance to try the moves, so feel free to show up even if you don’t have a dance partner. We rotate through the moves we teach in this lesson every week, so even if you attended the lesson last week, feel free to come back again…you’ll have a chance to really familiarize yourself with the basics and learn some cool new moves to show off every week. If this isn’t your first rodeo, and you would like to try something a little more challenging, check out our level 2 series from 7:00 to 8:00 pm!

After the lesson we social dance from 8:00-10:00, allowing you to really show off your stuff. We rotate our DJs every week, and each of them has a large library of swing songs to play you, guaranteeing the tunes never get old. Throughout the night we sometimes have small events, such as jam circles (where dancers can choose to show off their skill), snowballs (an introductory activity that gets everyone dancing), and birthday jams (celebrations for those having a birthday this month)–make sure to stick around!
