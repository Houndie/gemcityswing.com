Gem City Swing has opened the doors (and the dance floor) to swing dancers of all skill levels with lessons and social dancing! The beginner lesson starts at 7:30, the social dance is from 8:00 to 9:30, and the cover is $5 at the door.

Indoor swing dancing (or any partner dancing for that matter) is a high risk activity. We strongly recommend that everyone vaccinate and if you do not feel well, please stay home and get well so you can come join us on the dance floor.

Never been swing dancing before? Drop in our lesson at 7:30. No experience or dance partner required! We’ll teach you what you need to get out on the floor! Throughout the lesson we rotate partners frequently to give everyone a chance to practice moves, so show up even if you don’t have a dance partner. Our lessons change every week, so even if you attended the lesson last week, feel free to come back again…you’ll have a chance to really familiarize yourself with the basics and learn some cool new moves to show off every week.

After the lesson we social dance from 8:00-9:30, allowing you to really show off your stuff. We rotate our DJs every week, and each of them has a large library of swing songs to play you, guaranteeing the tunes never get old. Throughout the night we sometimes have small events, such as jam circles (where dancers can choose to show off their skill), snowballs (an introductory activity that gets everyone dancing), and birthday jams (celebrations for those having a birthday this month) – make sure to stick around!

Our weekly dances are held every Tuesday at the American Czechoslovakian Club. For the latest event information, please check our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/gemcityswing
