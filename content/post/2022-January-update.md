title: "Dance with us! Vaccination Required."

Gem City Swing has opened the doors (and the dance floor) to swing dancers of all skill levels with lessons and social dancing. Proof of vaccination is required, so please bring your COVID vaccination cards for admittance. The beginner lesson and/or social dance is $5 and the series lesson and social dance is $10.
Indoor swing dancing (or any partner dancing for that matter) is a high risk activity, so the club has voted to make vaccinations mandatory to participate. Masks will not be required for those vaccinated participants during lessons and social dance, but dancers are welcome to wear them if they choose to do so.
Never been swing dancing before? Drop in our beginner lesson at 7:30. No experience or dance partner required! We’ll teach you swing basics from scratch so you can get out on the floor and start dancing! Throughout the lesson we rotate partners frequently to give everyone a chance to practice moves, so show up even if you don’t have a dance partner. We teach different moves every week, so even if you attended the lesson last week, feel free to come back again…you’ll have a chance to really familiarize yourself with the basics and learn some cool new moves to show off every week.
If you’ve tried our beginner lesson and are ready to make a learning commitment, join us for our Series lessons from 7:00 to 8:00 pm! Our weekly series lessons build on each other throughout the month so you can keep improving and get the most out of swing dancing! We encourage both newcomers and seasoned dancers to take our series lessons.
After the lesson we social dance from 8:00-9:30, allowing you to really show off your stuff. We rotate our DJs every week, and each of them has a large library of swing songs to play you, guaranteeing the tunes never get old. Throughout the night we sometimes have small events, such as jam circles (where dancers can choose to show off their skill), snowballs (an introductory activity that gets everyone dancing), and birthday jams (celebrations for those having a birthday this month) – make sure to stick around!
