# How To Update

## Monthly Events

Create a new post in the content/post directory named "<month>-<year>-monthly-dances.md".

By default, Hugo will not build posts that are published in the future, so you need to be very careful of the front-matter at the top of the post file. The current practice is to publish monthly dance posts once month before they occur. For example, the June 2019 monthly dance post would be published on 01 May 2019.

Posts also have a summary section that controls what is displayed on the home page and post summary vs the full post page. Please include everything necessary to attend in a concise format above the "<!--more-->" block used to control the end of the summary.
